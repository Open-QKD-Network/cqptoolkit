@conference{HandHeld,
title = "Low cost, short range, free space quantum key distribution.",
abstract = "We present a Quantum Key Distribution system comprising a hand held transmitter device (Alice) and afixed terminal (Bob). The devices are highly asymmetrical with as much functionality as possible placedinto the Bob terminal (a 4u 19in. rack) which is much less restricted on its size. The small size(80x50x10mm) and relatively low complexity will allow the hand held Alice to be cheaply mass producedand therefore widely available.A potential use for this technology would be as a method to allow the general public to benefit from awider metropolitan or national QKD network by establishing key with trusted network nodes.The Alice device optics comprise 4 pulsed 300um LEDs behind polarizers to produce the photon statesfor the BB84 protocol. Light from the LEDs is combined and spatially filtered using a single mode fibre,the output of which is collimated by a lens at the optical output of the device. The device is currentlycontrolled via USB by a PC or mobile phone.The Bob terminal is split into two modules; broadly categorized as “optical” and “processing”. The opticalmodule contains beam splitters for state discrimination and photon detection. The processing modulecontains a PC, wireless router, time-tagging electronics and power supply. The modular approach allowsfor a flexible platform for different QKD experiments, for example change of wavelength or protocolwould involve switching out only the optical module.This work forms part of the Quantum Communications hub and was carried out with EPSRC funding(Quantum Communications Hub, grant no. EP/M013472/1).",
